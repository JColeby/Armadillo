This is where the text for the manual page will be kept.
always name the manual file "manual.txt" so the 'man' command will be able to find it.

***NOTICE***
The name of the parent folder needs to match the name of the cpp file EXACTLY!!!
Once you have created your command, add the name of the folder/cpp file to the customList.config
file on it own line and rerun build.bat to create an executable.
Don't tamper with the standard list unless you want to screw everything up.
Download and install custom commands from the internet at your own risk!!!
