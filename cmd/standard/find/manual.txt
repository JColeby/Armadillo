    Find Command:
        finds files or directories within the specified folder.

    Syntax:
        find <starting directory> <desired file> <flags>

    Flags:
        -d      will only match directory names
        -f      will only match file names
        -a      will recursively search the entire folder and return all files that match
        -s      will display the path from the starting directory instead of the full path
        -r      will recursively search through all folders inside the starting directory
        -h      allows you to search for and within hidden directories
        -i      case-insensitive matching

        -D      allows you to specify the recursion depth of your search (-r flag must be present for this to work).
                You will need to pass in a number directly after this flag (i.e. 'find ./ file.txt -rD 5' )
                flag aliases: --depth
