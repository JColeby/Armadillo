All builtin functions should take in 4 parameters: tokenizedInput, readHandle, writeHandle, and errorHandle
tokenizedInput contains the paramaters for the command. The handles correspond to the commands stdin, stdout, and stderr

When builtins want to display output or error messages, they will call the writeToPipe function and pass in the corresponding handle.
The reason we do this is because we can't set the stdin, stderr, or stdout of one thread without changing it for all the threads in the current process.
