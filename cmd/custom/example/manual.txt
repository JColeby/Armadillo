This is where the text for the manual page will be kept.
always name the manual file "manual.txt" so the 'man' command will be able to find it.

***NOTICE***
the directory name must match the command name, otherwise Armadillo will not be able to find your command.
Once you have created your command, add the name of the folder/command to the customList.config file on it own line and rerun build.bat to create an executable.
Don't tamper with the standard and builtin list unless you know what you are doing!!!
Download and install custom commands from the internet at your own risk!!!
